## üîÑ Working with Events

The integration fires these events you can use in your automations:

- `lsc_tuya_doorbell_button_press`: When someone presses the doorbell button
- `lsc_tuya_doorbell_motion`: When motion is detected
- `lsc_tuya_doorbell_connected`: When the doorbell device connects to Home Assistant
- `lsc_tuya_doorbell_disconnected`: When the doorbell device disconnects from Home Assistant

### Example Automation: Flash Lights When Doorbell Pressed

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Doorbell Press - Flash Lights"
    trigger:
      platform: event
      event_type: lsc_tuya_doorbell_button_press
    action:
      - service: light.turn_on
        entity_id: light.porch_light
        data:
          flash: short
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "Doorbell"
          message: "Someone is at the door!"
```

### Example Automation: Get Notified When Doorbell Disconnects

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Doorbell Disconnection Alert"
    trigger:
      platform: event
      event_type: lsc_tuya_doorbell_disconnected
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "Doorbell Alert"
          message: "Your doorbell has disconnected from Home Assistant"
          data:
            channel: "Doorbell Status"
            importance: high
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

Having issues? Try these steps:

- Enable debug logging by adding to your `configuration.yaml`:
  ```yaml
  logger:
    default: info
    logs:
      custom_components.lsc_tuya_doorbell: debug
  ```
- Ensure your doorbell is on the same network as Home Assistant
- Verify your device ID and local key are correct
- Check if your doorbell is using the default port (6668)
- If your doorbell disappears periodically, try setting a static IP for it in your router

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

This integration communicates with your doorbell using protocol version 3.3 of the Tuya local API. It establishes a persistent connection to listen for these specific datapoints:

- DP 185: Doorbell button press events
- DP 115: Motion detection events

The integration includes:
- Automatic credential-based device rediscovery if the IP changes
- Exponential backoff for reconnection attempts
- Decoded JSON payloads from button presses and motion events
