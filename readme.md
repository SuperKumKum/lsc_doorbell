4. Click "Download" next to the LSC Tuya Doorbell integration
5. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release
2. Copy the `custom_components/lsc_tuya_doorbell` directory to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Setting up is easy through the Home Assistant UI:

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Devices & Services**
2. Click the **"+ Add Integration"** button

4. If updating the protocol version, the integration will attempt to reconnect using the new version

You can also completely remove and re-add the integration if needed.

## üîç Finding Your Device's Local Key and ID

To use this integration, you'll need your doorbell's device ID and local key. Here are several methods to obtain these:

### Method 1: TinyTuya Wizard (Recommended)

1. Install TinyTuya: `pip install --user tinytuya`
2. Run the wizard: `python3 -m tinytuya wizard`
3. Follow the prompts to scan your network and retrieve device keys

### Method 2: Tuya IoT Platform

1. Create an account on [Tuya IoT Platform](https://iot.tuya.com/)
2. Create a cloud project and add your devices
3. Get device IDs and local keys from the project settings

### Method 3: Third-Party Tools

- Use [Tuya Cloudcutter](https://github.com/tuya-cloudcutter/tuya-cloudcutter) to unbind your device and generate local keys
- Use the [LSC2MQTT](https://github.com/ACE1046/LSC2MQTT) project which can help retrieve keys for LSC devices

## üîÑ Working with Events

The integration fires these events you can use in your automations:

- `lsc_tuya_doorbell_button_press`: When someone presses the doorbell button
- `lsc_tuya_doorbell_motion`: When motion is detected
- `lsc_tuya_doorbell_connected`: When the doorbell device connects to Home Assistant
- `lsc_tuya_doorbell_disconnected`: When the doorbell device disconnects from Home Assistant

### Example Automation: Flash Lights When Doorbell Pressed

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Doorbell Press - Flash Lights"
    trigger:
      platform: event
      event_type: lsc_tuya_doorbell_button_press
    action:
      - service: light.turn_on
        entity_id: light.porch_light
        data:
          flash: short
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "Doorbell"
          message: "Someone is at the door!"
```

### Example Automation: Record Video When Motion Detected

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Motion Detection - Record Video"
    trigger:
      platform: event
      event_type: lsc_tuya_doorbell_motion

      # Turn on camera recording for 30 seconds
      - service: camera.record
        target:
          entity_id: camera.front_door
        data:

          data:
            image: "/local/snapshots/front_door_latest.jpg"
            ttl: 0
            priority: high
```

### Example Automation: Get Notified When Doorbell Disconnects

    trigger:
      - platform: event
        event_type: lsc_tuya_doorbell_connected
      - platform: event
        event_type: lsc_tuya_doorbell_disconnected
    action:
      - service: persistent_notification.create
        data:
          title: >
            Doorbell {{ trigger.event.event_type.split('_')[-1] | title }}
          message: >
            The doorbell {{ trigger.event.event_type.split('_')[-1] | title }} at {{ trigger.event.data.timestamp }}
            {% if trigger.event.event_type == 'lsc_tuya_doorbell_connected' %}
            IP Address: {{ trigger.event.data.host }}
            {% endif %}
          notification_id: "doorbell_status_{{ trigger.event.event_type.split('_')[-1] }}"
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

Having issues? Try these steps:

- Enable debug logging by adding to your `configuration.yaml`:
  ```yaml
  logger:
    default: info
    logs:
      custom_components.lsc_tuya_doorbell: debug
  ```
- Try different protocol versions (3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4) if your doorbell isn't connecting successfully
- Ensure your doorbell is on the same network as Home Assistant
- Verify your device ID and local key are correct
- Check if your doorbell is using the default port (6668)
- If your doorbell disappears periodically, try setting a static IP for it in your router

### Protocol Version Troubleshooting

If you're having connection issues, try these protocol versions in order:
1. 3.3 (default)
2. 3.1 (works with many older Tuya devices)
3. 3.4 (for newer Tuya devices)
4. 3.2 (less common)

You can diagnose which protocol version works best using the included `test_doorbell_tinytuya.py` script in the dev-scripts directory:

```bash
python3 dev-scripts/test_doorbell_tinytuya.py --ip <DOORBELL_IP> --id <DEVICE_ID> --key <LOCAL_KEY> --version 3.1 --debug
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

This integration communicates with your doorbell using your selected protocol version of the Tuya local API. It establishes a persistent connection to listen for these specific datapoints:

- DP 185: Doorbell button press events
- DP 115: Motion detection events

These datapoint numbers can be customized in your configuration if your device uses different datapoints.

The integration includes:
- Automatic credential-based device rediscovery if the IP changes
- Multi-protocol support to ensure compatibility with different doorbell variants
- Exponential backoff for reconnection attempts
- Decoded JSON payloads from button presses and motion events

## üß™ Development Tools

The repository includes several development tools to help troubleshoot and test your doorbell:

- `test_doorbell_pytuya.py`: Test connection using our internal pytuya module
- `test_doorbell_tinytuya.py`: Test connection using TinyTuya library with different protocol versions
- `scan_for_tuya_devices.py`: Scan your network for any Tuya devices and their details

You can run these tools directly from the `dev-scripts/` directory to diagnose connection issues.
