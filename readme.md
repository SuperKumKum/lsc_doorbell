You can also completely remove and re-add the integration if needed.

## üîç Finding Your Device's Local Key and ID

To use this integration, you'll need your doorbell's device ID and local key. Here are several methods to obtain these:

### Method 1: TinyTuya Wizard (Recommended)

1. Install TinyTuya: `pip install --user tinytuya`
2. Run the wizard: `python3 -m tinytuya wizard`
3. Follow the prompts to scan your network and retrieve device keys

### Method 2: Tuya IoT Platform

1. Create an account on [Tuya IoT Platform](https://iot.tuya.com/)
2. Create a cloud project and add your devices
3. Get device IDs and local keys from the project settings

### Method 3: Third-Party Tools

- Use [Tuya Cloudcutter](https://github.com/tuya-cloudcutter/tuya-cloudcutter) to unbind your device and generate local keys
- Use the [LSC2MQTT](https://github.com/ACE1046/LSC2MQTT) project which can help retrieve keys for LSC devices

## üîÑ Working with Automations

### Device Triggers

The integration provides clean, easy-to-use device triggers that you can select directly in the automation UI:

1. Create a new automation
2. Select "Device" as your trigger
3. Choose your doorbell device
4. Select one of these trigger types:
   - **Doorbell button pressed** - When someone presses the doorbell button
   - **Motion detected** - When motion is detected 
   - **Device connected** - When the doorbell connects to Home Assistant
   - **Device disconnected** - When the doorbell disconnects from Home Assistant

These named device triggers make it easy to create automations without confusion.

### Automation Helper Service

If you're having trouble with the automation UI or want to quickly create consistent automations, you can use the included helper service:

1. Go to **Developer Tools** ‚Üí **Services**
2. Select the `lsc_tuya_doorbell.create_automation` service
3. Enter these parameters:
   - **Device ID**: Select your doorbell device from the dropdown
   - **Event Type**: Choose the type of event (button_press, motion, connected, disconnected)
   - **Automation Name** (optional): A descriptive name for your automation

4. Call the service, and it will generate a complete automation template and show it in a notification
5. Copy the YAML template and add it to your automations.yaml file, or use it to create a new automation in the UI

This service helps you create automations with the correct event syntax for your specific doorbell device without having to worry about constructing the event names manually.

### Event Triggers and Binary Sensors

The integration provides both device triggers and binary sensors that respond to doorbell events:

#### Binary Sensors

Two key binary sensors are created for each doorbell device:

- **Doorbell Button**: A binary sensor (`binary_sensor.<device_name>_doorbell_button`) that turns ON briefly when someone presses the doorbell button
- **Motion Detection**: A binary sensor (`binary_sensor.<device_name>_motion_detection`) that turns ON briefly when motion is detected

These binary sensors are linked to the datapoints specified in your integration configuration:

- The **Doorbell Button** sensor is linked to the "Doorbell Button Event" datapoint (usually DP 185)
- The **Motion Detection** sensor is linked to the "Motion Detection Event" datapoint (usually DP 115)

If your doorbell uses different datapoints, you can customize these in the integration's configuration settings.

#### Device-Specific Events

For more advanced use cases, the integration fires device-specific events (generic events are no longer used):

- `lsc_tuya_doorbell_button_press_front_door`: Button press on the "Front Door" doorbell
- `lsc_tuya_doorbell_motion_front_door`: Motion detected by the "Front Door" doorbell
- `lsc_tuya_doorbell_connected_front_door`: "Front Door" doorbell connected
- `lsc_tuya_doorbell_disconnected_front_door`: "Front Door" doorbell disconnected

The naming format is `lsc_tuya_doorbell_<event_type>_<device_name>` where `<device_name>` is the lowercase, underscore-separated version of your configured device name.

These events are also mapped to the datapoints specified in your integration configuration, making it easy to customize if your doorbell uses different datapoints than the defaults. This makes it easier to create automations specific to each doorbell device.

### üì∏ Displaying Doorbell Images

When a doorbell event occurs, the integration will automatically extract image URLs from various payload formats and make them available in your Home Assistant. The image URLs are stored in the connection status sensor attributes and can be displayed using Lovelace cards.

#### Connection Status Sensor Attributes

The connection status sensor (`sensor.lsc_tuya_doorbell_connection_status`) now includes the following attributes:

- `doorbell_count`: Total number of doorbell button press events
- `motion_count`: Total number of motion detection events
- `last_doorbell_time`: Timestamp of the last doorbell press
- `last_motion_time`: Timestamp of the last motion detection
- `last_doorbell_image`: URL of the image from the last doorbell press
- `last_motion_image`: URL of the image from the last motion detection
- `doorbell_image_url`: Same as last_doorbell_image, formatted for Lovelace cards
- `motion_image_url`: Same as last_motion_image, formatted for Lovelace cards

#### Lovelace Card for Doorbell Images

```yaml
type: picture-entity
entity: sensor.lsc_tuya_doorbell_connection_status
image: "{{ state_attr('sensor.lsc_tuya_doorbell_connection_status', 'doorbell_image_url') }}"
name: Last Doorbell Image
show_state: false
show_name: true
camera_view: auto
```

#### Lovelace Card for Motion Detection Images

```yaml
type: picture-entity
entity: sensor.lsc_tuya_doorbell_connection_status
image: "{{ state_attr('sensor.lsc_tuya_doorbell_connection_status', 'motion_image_url') }}"
name: Last Motion Image
show_state: false
show_name: true
camera_view: auto
```

#### Picture-Elements Card with Latest Event Information

This card shows both doorbell and motion images along with event counts and timestamps:

```yaml

        data:
          title: "Front Door Alert"
          message: "Someone is at the front door"
          data:
            channel: "Front Door"
            
  - alias: "Side Door Button Press"
    trigger:
      platform: event
      event_type: lsc_tuya_doorbell_button_press_side_door
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "Side Door Alert"
          message: "Someone is at the side door"
          data:
            channel: "Side Door"
            
  - alias: "Multiple Doorbell Common Actions"
    trigger:
      # Trigger for any of your doorbells - list all of them
      platform: event
      event_type:
        - lsc_tuya_doorbell_button_press_front_door
        - lsc_tuya_doorbell_button_press_side_door
        - lsc_tuya_doorbell_button_press_back_door
    action:
      - service: light.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: light.entry_hall
        data:
          brightness_pct: 100
          
      # Flash all lights for any doorbell
      - service: light.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: light.living_room
        data:
          flash: short
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

Having issues? Try these steps:

- Enable debug logging by adding to your `configuration.yaml`:
  ```yaml
  logger:
    default: info
    logs:
      custom_components.lsc_tuya_doorbell: debug
  ```
- Try different protocol versions (3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4) if your doorbell isn't connecting successfully
- Ensure your doorbell is on the same network as Home Assistant
- Verify your device ID and local key are correct
- Check if your doorbell is using the default port (6668)
- If your doorbell disappears periodically, try setting a static IP for it in your router

### Troubleshooting Image URLs

If your doorbell images aren't appearing in Home Assistant:

1. Check the debug logs to see if image URLs are being extracted:
   ```yaml
   # In configuration.yaml
   logger:
     default: info
     logs:
       custom_components.lsc_tuya_doorbell: debug
   ```

2. Look for log entries containing "Extracted image URL" to see if URLs are being found.

3. Verify that images exist in the attributes of the connection status sensor:
   ```
   Developer Tools ‚Üí States ‚Üí Search for "lsc_tuya_doorbell_connection_status"
   ```

4. If no image URLs are being found, try pressing the doorbell button multiple times to send different types of payloads.

5. Some Tuya doorbell models use different payload formats. The integration now supports multiple formats:
   - Standard Tuya cloud storage format with bucket and files
   - Direct URL in 'url' field
   - URL in 'image_url' field
   - Cloud image with fileId and timeStamp
   - Image paths in any string field
   - Nested objects with URLs

6. If you identify a new image URL format not handled by the integration, please report it in the GitHub issues.

### Protocol Version Troubleshooting

If you're having connection issues, try these protocol versions in order:
1. 3.3 (default)
2. 3.1 (works with many older Tuya devices)
3. 3.4 (for newer Tuya devices)
4. 3.2 (less common)

You can diagnose which protocol version works best using the included `test_doorbell_tinytuya.py` script in the dev-scripts directory:

```bash
python3 dev-scripts/test_doorbell_tinytuya.py --ip <DOORBELL_IP> --id <DEVICE_ID> --key <LOCAL_KEY> --version 3.1 --debug
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

This integration communicates with your doorbell using your selected protocol version of the Tuya local API. It establishes a persistent connection to listen for these specific datapoints:

- DP 185: Doorbell button press events
- DP 115: Motion detection events

These datapoint numbers can be customized in your configuration if your device uses different datapoints.

The integration includes:
- Automatic credential-based device rediscovery if the IP changes
- Multi-protocol support to ensure compatibility with different doorbell variants
- Exponential backoff for reconnection attempts
- Decoded JSON payloads from button presses and motion events

## üß™ Development Tools

The repository includes several development tools to help troubleshoot and test your doorbell:

- `test_doorbell_pytuya.py`: Test connection using our internal pytuya module
- `test_doorbell_tinytuya.py`: Test connection using TinyTuya library with different protocol versions
- `scan_for_tuya_devices.py`: Scan your network for any Tuya devices and their details

You can run these tools directly from the `dev-scripts/` directory to diagnose connection issues.
